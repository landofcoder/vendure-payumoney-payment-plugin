# Payumoney plugin

This plugin enables payments to be processed by [PayUMoney](https://www.payu.in/), a popular payment provider.

The PayUMoney Node library provides convenient access to the PayUMoney API from applications written in server-side JavaScript.

## Documentation
See the [PayUMoney API docs](https://www.payumoney.com/dev-guide/apireference.html).

The package needs to be configured with your account's Merchant Key, Mecrhant Salt and Authorization Key, which are available in your [PayUMoney Dashboard](https://www.payumoney.com/merchant/settings/#/myaccount).
